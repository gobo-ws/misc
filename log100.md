**T24 LOG100**    

[log100.json](log100.json) - Example output from Log100 webserver  
JSON API: http://hostname:port/?json

Tested with [T24 LOG100](https://www.mantracourt.com/software/t24-range/t24log100-channel-data-logging-visualisation-software) and [Broadweigh Log 100](https://www.broadweigh.com/product/data-logging-viewing-software/)  
Should in theory also work with other branded versions that are based on LOG100, like LMS-LOG100.
