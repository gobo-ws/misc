**T24 LOG100**    

[log100.json](log100.json) - Very simple Node-RED flow for interacting with the LOG100 API  

[log100-output.json](log100-output.json) - Example output from LOG100 webserver  
JSON API-URL: http://hostname:port/?json (Does not support HTTPS, use a reverse proxy if needed)  

Tested with [T24 LOG100](https://www.mantracourt.com/software/t24-range/t24log100-channel-data-logging-visualisation-software), [Broadweigh Log 100](https://www.broadweigh.com/product/data-logging-viewing-software/) and [PROTOS Force Monitoring](https://www.protos-one.com/force-measurement)  
Should in theory also work with other branded versions that are based on LOG100.
