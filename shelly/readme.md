## **Shelly to DMX**

Control your [Shelly relays]([https://www.shelly.com/en-se/products/switching-and-triggering#unfiltered) relays using your lighting console (DMX, sACN, or Art-Net protocol) powered by Shelly's API integrated with the open source [OLA](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/) (Open Lighting Architecture) software.

Easily create a custom-designed DMX wall panel using the [Shelly Plus I4](https://www.shelly.com/en-se/products/product-overview/shelly-plus-i4-1) to elevate your theater productions and smaller events.
